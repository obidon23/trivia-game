TRIVIA GAME

-----WHAT I DID-----
After working on other projects using javascript and jQuery, I was excited to work on this project. Trivia is a hobby of mine, which added to my interest. The assignment was to build a trivia game that incorporated a timer function.

-----WHAT I LEARNED-----
The biggest new concept in this task was to utilize a timer. By the time I started this project I was getting much more comfortable with js and jQuery, which freed me to add some additional bells and whistles. Once I had the basic game functionality working properly I was able to download a fun font and enhance the end game scenarios based on player scores. I learned how to play audio clips.


-----WHAT'S NEXT-----
If I revisit this game, I will likely add some animation to the timer. Maybe have a bar that shrinks as time elapses. I'd also expand the start of game to allow players to pick from various categories.
